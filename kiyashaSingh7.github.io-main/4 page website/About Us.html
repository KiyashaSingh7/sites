            Before we tell you more about us lets explain what <em>Manga</em> is.
            The word Manga, when translated directly, means 'whimsical drawings'. Manga are typically 'comic books' as the West understands them; rather, they represent pieces of Japanese culture and history.
             <br>
             <br>   
             Manga is something we at <em>King Manga</em> are passionate about.<br>
            Many are familiar with anime but they are not familiarised with the source, and that is <strong>manga</strong>.
             
             <br>
             <br>
             We formed a group in the midst of 2020, where Lockdowns were imposed. During that timeframe reading manga was an outlet for me, however it was becoming very obvious that manga sites were very data-consuming and some were hard to find without having to search for them within other manga sites. present.<br> 
             We at King manga are trying to constantly ensure quality and variety with our manga's. We dont only specialize in manga, but rather include manwha and manhua.<br>
